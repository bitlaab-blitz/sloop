**Simple Bucket Storage**

Sloop is a lightweight, standalone bucket storage system written entirely in Zig. It provides a simple, self-contained way to manage buckets and objects without relying on external services or compatibility layers.

If you need more functionality or code coverage, Please create an issue at [**Sloop Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-blitz/sloop) and buy us some coffee.
